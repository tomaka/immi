//! A circular progress bar is a circle that fills itself to indicate some sort of progression.
//! 
//! A widget like this is composed of two images:
//! 
//! - The widget when empty.
//! - The widget when full. Since this one is drawn over the previous one, it can also just be the
//!   difference between empty and full.
//! 
//! This module supposes that the center of the circular progress bar is the center of the image.
//! The direction is always clockwise. <-- TODO: allow choosing this
